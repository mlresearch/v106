abstract: Blood glucose value prediction is an important task in diabetes management.
  While it is reported that glucose concentration is sensitive to social context such
  as mood, physical activity, stress, diet, alongside the influence of diabetes pathologies,
  we need more research on data and methodologies to incorporate and evaluate signals
  about such temporal context into prediction models. Person-generated data sources,
  such as actively contributed surveys as well as passively mined data from social
  media offer opportunity to capture such context, however the self-reported nature
  and sparsity of such data mean that such data are noisier and less specific than
  physiological measures such as blood glucose values themselves. Therefore, here
  we propose a Gaussian Process model to both address these data challenges and combine
  blood glucose and latent feature representations of contextual data for a novel
  multi-signal blood glucose prediction task. We find this approach outperforms common
  methods for multi-variate data, as well as using the blood glucose values in isolation.
  Given a robust evaluation across two blood glucose datasets with different forms
  of contextual information, we conclude that multi-signal Gaussian Processes can
  improve blood glucose prediction by using contextual information and may provide
  a significant shift in blood glucose prediction research and practice.
